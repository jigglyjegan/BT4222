# BT4222
This repository contains the code and datasets used in BT4222 final project submission. Unfortunately, the "hdb data with distances.csv" file was too big to upload to github, hence you can download that dataset from here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1--WFp15ERkslTBLRMeTylKAzA6Np8RGS/view?usp=sharing

There are 3 python notebooks in total:
1. Data cleaning and Feature engineering
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Data preprocessing and Model Building

### The codes were ran in Google Colab, and the datasets were read directly from my google drive folder. Hence, if you were to clone this repo and run on your local machine, please remember to change the directories when you read and write to csv files
